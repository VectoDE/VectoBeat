# VectoBeat Roadmap (Next Up)

This roadmap lists what has **not** shipped yet and will guide development through 2026. It matches the control-panel `/roadmap` page and accounts for the forum roll-out.

## Reliability & Automation (2026)
- Self-Healing Voice Grid — auto-replace failing Lavalink nodes and rejoin mid-track (Building).
- Queue Copilots — AI queue hygiene, loudness smoothing, premium-slot protection (Building).
- Incident Mirroring — clone live guild configs into staging before fixes (Planned).
- Charge-Aware Subscriptions — Stripe webhooks unlock tiers instantly per guild (Building).
- Zero-Downtime Security Patching — monthly CVE sweeps, hot-reloadable bot/worker patches, dependency risk scoring (Planned).

## Community & Forum Launch
- Forum Private Alpha — Pro+ communities test topic spaces, playbooks, role-gated threads (Alpha).
- Support Desk Pairing — solved tickets/retros auto-sync to the forum KB (Building).
- Moderator Toolkit — macros, templates, badges for community leads (Beta).
- Public Read Access — browse best practices; posting stays gated to verified customers (Planned).
- Forum Telemetry — moderation/audit events exposed to admins and SRE dashboards (Planned).

## Telemetry, Compliance, & Security
- Expanded Telemetry Webhooks — live queue/billing/safety events to customer monitoring (Building).
- Adaptive Mastering Pipeline — per-track loudness normalisation (Planned).
- Compliance Mode — export-ready safety logs, GDPR tooling, residency controls (Planned).
- Trust & Safety Exports — one-click bundles with consent, permissions, retention (Planned).
- Enterprise Hardening Pack — SSO/SAML, SCIM lifecycle, signed audit/event payloads (Planned).

## Long-Term Vision
- Bot-to-Bot Federation — coordinate multiple instances for mega-events (Concept).
- Predictive Health Scoring — surface degradation before listeners notice (Concept).
- Plugin Marketplace — automation/analytics/moderation add-ons (Concept).
- Full White-Label Mode — custom domains, embeds, branding for enterprise (Concept).

## Timeline Targets
